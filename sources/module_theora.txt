theora module
=============

.. module:: theora

Currently all Python wrappers to ``libtheora`` are in this module. It consists
of two classes: ``Theora`` (for decoding any theora file) and ``TheoraEncoder``
(for encoding any theora file). The whole documentation below is automatically
generated from the docstrings and the best way to get started is to read the
class docstring, which contains an example how to get started. Every single
method of both classes is documented by an example of usage, so simply reading
the docstring in ``ipython`` should be enough to understand how to use the
method.
